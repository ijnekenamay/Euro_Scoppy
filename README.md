# Euro_Scoppy
Project to make an Eurorack version of "([Scoppy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xyz.fhdm.scoppy&hl=ja&gl=US))" oscilloscope that works with Raspberry pi pico and Android phone.

!!!!!!! note !!!!!!!!
- I had long forgotten about this project. I finished the test build and verified that it works fine, but then I remembered I needed another oscilloscope for calibration and threw it away. Nothing wrong with just looking at the waveform shape. Enjoy.
- Payment for the "Scoppy" application is required to use the two channels.
- This project is ongoing.
